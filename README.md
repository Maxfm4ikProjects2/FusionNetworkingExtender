# FusionNetworkingExtender
## About
### A fork of FusionNetworkingPlus, aims to add more networking layers!

### Currently, there is only Riptide Layer, since mod is being worked on right now.

### Just a note, you dont need to have installed FusionNetworkingPlus to make this mod work.

## Current Network Layers:
### - Riptide
+ Server authoritative P2P networking for lower latency and standalone use!
+ No public lobbies because P2P...

## Current Working On Layers:
### - Nakama
+ Self hosted, web-socket based networking popular for its use in competitive games.
### - EOS
+ Free, relay based networking similar to Steamworks but available on all platforms. (though quite complicated to implement)
